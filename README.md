# Machine Learning 101
This repo is my own personal guide to machine learning and contains knowledge from a variety of courses, blog posts and research papers that I have encountered that have been useful to me on my journey to becoming a Machine Learning Engineer. A detailed list of these links can be found at the bottom of this page.

## Usage/License
There isn't one! Please feel free to use these notes and code templates for your own products, everything here is free to utilise as you see fit :)

The majority of these notes and findings will be placed within the wiki, please pick the appropriate link from the table of contents below to navigate to the area of your choice.

### Coding Language & Libraries Used
All coding templates are written in Python 3.6 and the IDE used to create them was using Anaconda's Spyder, you can download Anaconda [here](https://www.anaconda.com/download/).

The Machine Learning models are coded using the following libraries: Scikit-learn, NumPy, Matplotlib and Pandas.

The Deep Learning models are coded using the following libraries: Tensorflow, Keras, PyTorch. The Supervised models used Keras & Unsupervised use PyTorch.

The Computer Vision models are coded using the following libraries: OpenCV for face recognition and smile detection, PyTorch for Object Detection & GANs.

The Artificial Intelligence models are coded using the following libraries: PyTorch for all models.

The Natural Language Processing models are coded using the following libraries: Tensorflow.

## Table of Contents
The sections consist of: Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing. These are split into multiple subsections that link to wiki pages for further information.
